    <h1>Minor Project - Physics Informed Neural Networks</h1>
    <p>As Part of the AI minor at TU Delft, students spend the last 3 weeks of the minor working full time on a project given by a Prof/Phd student from diff faculties. Students pick the projects and work in groups. For our project we worked on training a model with Unet architecture using CFD simulation results for a specific case, with constant boundary conditions.</p>
    <p>One normal simulation, using OpenFoam, would take around an hour. Right now they have a ton of simulation results laying around. The aim was to use these to train a model (a UNET) to learn from these simulation results. This way the model can be used instead of using a CFD solver every single time a small thing changes in the input. With our trained model, one simulation takes less than a millisecond. Using a CFD solver it takes more than an hour, needing a lot more computational power.</p>
