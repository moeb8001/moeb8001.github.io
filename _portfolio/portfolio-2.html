This project was a cornerstone of the Artificial Intelligence minor at TU Delft, where students dedicate the final three weeks to a full-time project. Collaborating under the guidance of professors and PhD students from various faculties, we had the opportunity to delve deep into real-world applications of AI.

Challenge:  Using the Unet architecture, our goal was to leverage existing CFD simulation data to train a model capable of accurately predicting fluid dynamics under constant boundary conditions for which a ton of data was available. Typically, a single CFD simulation for this specific case, using OpenFoam software, requires about an hour to complete, consuming significant computational resources. Since there was already a ton of data available from previous simulations run using Openfoam, the aim was to take advantage of these data. 

Solution: Aftyer doing extensive literature study, we trained a Unet model with a wealth of pre-existing simulation data. By doing this we aimed to create an alternative to traditional CFD solvers (when it comes to cases for which a ton of data is already available). This approach promised to drastically reduce the time and computational power needed for simulations, allowing for rapid iterations and adjustments.
