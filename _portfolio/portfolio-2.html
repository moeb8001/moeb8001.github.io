This project was a cornerstone of the Artificial Intelligence minor at TU Delft, where students dedicate the final three weeks to a full-time project. Collaborating under the guidance of professors and PhD students from various faculties, we had the opportunity to delve deep into real-world applications of AI. Each group works on a unique project. Our project was in context of shallow Physics informed neural networks for CFD simulations.

<br/>
Challenge:  Using the Unet architecture, our goal was to leverage existing CFD simulation data to train a model capable of accurately predicting fluid dynamics under constant boundary conditions for which a ton of data was available. Typically, a single CFD simulation for this specific case, using OpenFoam software, requires about an hour to complete, consuming significant computational resources. Since there was already a ton of data available from previous simulations run using Openfoam, the aim was to take advantage of these data. 

<br/>
Solution: Aftyer doing extensive literature study, we trained a Unet model with a wealth of pre-existing simulation data. By doing this we aimed to create an alternative to traditional CFD solvers (when it comes to cases for which a ton of data is already available). This approach promised to drastically reduce the time and computational power needed for simulations, allowing for rapid iterations and adjustments. With our trained model, one simulation takes less than a millisecond. Yes, the results will not be 100% as accurate as the CFD solver results, but the inference time will be supppeer low and results are reliable/accurate enough for when it comes to doing a preliminary research. This allows for rapid iterations and adjustments and getting results of all the iterations while taking so muchhh less time than getting results for one single simulation using a CFD solver.
