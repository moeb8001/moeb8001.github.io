title: "Minor Project - Physics Informed Neural Networks"
excerpt: "As Part of the AI minor at TU Delft, students spend the last 3 weeks of the minor working full time on a project given by a Prof/Phd stuent from diff faculties. Students pick the projects and work in groups. For our project we worked on training a model with Unet architecture using CFD simulation results for a specific case, with constant boundary conditions.<br/>

One normal simulation, using OpenFoam, would take around an hour. With our trained model, one simulation takes less than a milli second.
